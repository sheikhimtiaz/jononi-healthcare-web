  <h3>Therapeutic Sessions</h3>
  <p class="pt-3">Find or create your therapeutic sessions with Jononi Assistant.</p>
  <p class="pt-3">[ATTENTION: Full system of how the users will interact with creating therapeutic sessions is yet to design.]</p>
  <p class="pt-3">[ATTENTION: This can't be plain form, tables or texts. It needs to be real time interactive. Just because I implemented something from 1990 does not mean I cant do anything more. I need a design. Also I establishing a base portal was a lot of work. Now I hope you all can find motivations to submit new ideas, issues and features. We will consider more than one interaction hera and after several mockup test/ discussion, we will implement that one feature,that will be scalable in the future.]</p>
